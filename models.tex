About interpreting:
- Main objective (quadratic trend... an occasional cubic?)
- observational, not mechanistic
- (non-)use of AIC

Variable Selection
- See habitat
- Kitchen sink approach
  - time required to explore across species and forests
  - difficulty in applying standard information criteria
  - which variables are looking less important?
- Restriction to 1995-present

Random Effects -
- Zeroing out of non-significants
  - non-negative so far
- Habitat
- Obs, obsyr, yearf (and interpretations of each)

Preliminary Findings and Observations:
- Dispersion, Zero-Inflation
- First-time observer effects
- shifting importance among obs-yr and habitats
- see spreadsheets

Future steps
- well, obviously, we have to construct a model
- Comparison to simple linear regression over time
- Effect of distance by species (by observer?)
- Species-observer interactions?
