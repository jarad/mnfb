Put all R scripts here. These scripts are run from the directory below (../) so reading any files is done relative to that directory. Any output files, e.g. .RData files, should be put in the R/ directory via save.image("R/foo.RData"). 

The file common/functions.R contains any functions that are used in multiple scripts.
